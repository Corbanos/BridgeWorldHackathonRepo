# Netcode Connection Error Fix Guide

## The Problem
The error `[Netcode] A ConnectionRequestMessage was received from the server on the client side` occurs when you have multiple NetworkManager instances or conflicting network systems.

## The Solution
Use ONLY the SimpleNetworkManager system. I've disabled the conflicting systems.

## Required Unity Setup

### 1. Create a Clean NetworkManager GameObject
1. **Delete** any existing NetworkManager GameObjects in your scene
2. Create a new empty GameObject
3. Name it "NetworkManager"
4. Add these components:
   - **NetworkManager** (Unity's official component)
   - **Unity Transport** (should auto-add)
   - **SimpleNetworkManager** (our script)

### 2. Configure the NetworkManager Component
1. Select the NetworkManager GameObject
2. In the NetworkManager component:
   - **Player Prefab**: Drag your Player prefab here
   - **Network Prefabs List**: Size 1, add your Player prefab
   - **Enable Scene Management**: Check this
   - **Auto Spawn Player Prefab Client Side**: Check this

### 3. Prepare Your Player Prefab
1. Select your Player GameObject in the scene
2. Add Component → **NetworkObject**
3. Add Component → **NetworkPlayer** (our script)
4. Add Component → **NetworkBuildSystem** (for building)
5. Drag the Player to Project window to make it a Prefab
6. **Delete the Player from the scene** (it will be spawned by NetworkManager)

### 4. Disable Conflicting Systems
The following scripts are now disabled to prevent conflicts:
- ✅ **IslandNetworkManager** - Disabled
- ✅ **RuntimePlayerSpawner** - Disabled
- ✅ **SimpleNetworkManager** - Active (this is what you want)

## How to Test
1. **Host**: Press Tab → Press H
2. **Join**: Press Tab → Press J
3. **Building**: Press B to toggle build mode

## What Was Fixed
- Disabled conflicting network managers
- Ensured only one NetworkManager instance
- Used Unity's built-in player spawning system
- Fixed connection request message error

The error should now be gone!
